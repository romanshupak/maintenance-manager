            <p class="lead">
              The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) is an International Labour Organization (ILO) convention, number 186,
              established in 2006 as the fourth pillar of international maritime law and embodies "all up-to-date
              standards of existing international maritime labour Conventions and Recommendations, as well as the
              fundamental principles to be found in other international labour Conventions".The other pillars are
              the SOLAS, STCW and MARPOL. The treaties applies to all ships entering the harbours of parties to the
              treaty (port states), as well as to all ships flying the flag of state party (flag states, as of 2021:
              over 91 per cent).

              Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), according to International Labour Organization, provides a broad
              perspective to the seafarerâ€™s rights and fortification at work.

              The convention entered into force on 20 August 2013, one year after registering 30 ratifications of
              countries representing over 33 per cent of the world gross tonnage of ships. Already after five
              ratifications the ratifying countries (Bahamas, Norway, Liberia, Marshall Islands, and Panama) represented
              over 43 per cent of the gross world tonnage (which is over 33 per cent; the second requirement for
              entry into force). As of August 2021, the convention has been ratified by 97 states representing over
              91 per cent of global shipping.

              Although the Convention has not been ratified worldwide, it has widespread effect because vessels from
              non-signatory states that attempt to enter ports of signatory states may face arrest and penalties for
              non-compliance with the MLC.
